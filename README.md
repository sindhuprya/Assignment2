# Python Control Structures – Assignment

This repository contains two Python scripts based on Module 3: Control Structures in Python.

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

* Prompts the user to enter an integer.
* Uses an if-else statement to determine if the number is even or odd.
* Displays the result.

##  Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50

* Uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to 50.
* Calculates the total sum of all integers in the range.
* Prints the final sum.

##  Files Included

* `Assig2task1.py`
* `Assign2task2.py`
* `README.md`

## ✅ How to Run

Run each script using:

```bash
python Assig2task1.py
python Assign2task2.py
```


* Ensure both scripts are tested before submission.
* These programs demonstrate basic Python control structures as covered in Module 3.
